# The first principle component (âˆ’1/square_root(5) , 2/square_root(5) ) 
# which is the vector that has the direction that all data points have the largest variance.
# 
# In this example, the direction that all data points have the largest variance is the slope of the line shown in above graph.

# 3.
# The second principle component ( 2/square_root(5) , 1/square_root(5)) 
# 
# which is the vector that has the direction that all data points have the least variance.
# 
# In this example, the direction that all data points have the least variance is the slope of the line that is perpendicular to the line shown above graph.
